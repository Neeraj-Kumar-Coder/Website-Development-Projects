            <p>I love to learn new things. And when I entered the world of programming, it seems like magic happening to
                me. We can do anything we want, whatever we can think we can do it. This is the true use of technology.
                I learned programming languages like C, C++, Python and interested in learning more. Along with
                programming I am also learning development, more specifically Website Development using HTML, CSS, Java
                script and will learn more when needed. Beside all this I am greatly interested in Astronomy. Universe,
                celestial bodies all these stuffs amaze me. Whenever I get some time I read about it. Let's create a new
                world with Computer and Technologies.</p>

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am Neeraj Kumar. I am 20 years old and currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with
                a specialization in Artificial Intelligence (CSAI) from the Netaji Subhas University of Technology. I
                had finished my schooling at Evergreen Public School and currently living with my nuclear family in
                Delhi. I have many hobbies like sketching, doing origami, playing outdoor games, etc., but now I get
                little or no time to do all these activities, although I still love to do them. I love to try new things
                and want to learn more and more. I am a little impatient that sometimes results in anxiety, although I
                tried not to, but that didn't work for me. I had not planned much about my future because experience had
                shown me that didn't work. Presently I am trying to learn as much as possible during my four years of
                Engineering journey that will help me in developing my personal and technical skills. This is all that I
                have thought for myself. I love myself, my family, and my country very much and want to make them proud.
